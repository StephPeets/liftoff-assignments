### Overview

PERRMA: PErsonnel Resource & Relationship Management App

An orientation web app for new employees with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the on-boarding process. 

Provides new employees with easy access to everything they need to get started on the right foot. 

A one-stop shop with everything a new hire needs to settle into their role within their department of the company.

Make your new employees feel at home with a PERRMA homepage. A page of their own where they can find all of the tools they need to go from being a new employee to becoming a valued member of your team!

After filling out a form with their standard information, an employee will receive an email with a username, temporary password, and a link to their PERRMA page with the following...

### Features

Each of the following would be its own section:

- roadmap of specific tasks an employee needs to complete to finish the hiring/training process

- useful contacts page: 
  - HR, IT Helpdesk, Assigned "Buddy", Immediate Supervisor, Department Manager
  - link to company-wide employee contact list

- forms page with links to new hire paperwork (Employee Handbook, Company Policy, W4s, etc) with option to complete everything through DocuSign (or something similar)

- search bar with option to search within their individual PERRMA pages, the company's internal employee site, or Google

- Information page listing essential tech (software, email, mobile apps) and links to docs/tutorials, also information on how to effectively use Google

- Calendar page that includes company's general schedule:
  -  holidays, industry deadlines, company/HR related deadlines (pay-periods, open enrollment, employee reviews, etc), birthdays (opt-in only)

- some sort of form to provide anonymous feedback to HR

### Technologies

I only know how to connect an app to a database using the unit 2 stack so I guess:
  - Java
  - Spring Boot
  - MySQL
  - Hibernate
  - Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn

- How to make a search bar with options to adjust broadness of scope of the search 
- How to embed a calendar (Google Calendar api?)
